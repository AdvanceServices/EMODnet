 This is a tube - building , spionid polychaete , and a transient member of the present sand flat .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 In summer , it reaches its peak numerical density and is the most dominant infaunal organism ( Tamaki & Kikuchi , 1983 ; Tamaki , 1984a ) .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 The maximum body length is 8 mm .	 O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O
 This species collects detritus on the sediment surface with its palps and makes a dwelling tube that protrudes above the sediment surface .

 It is basically a suspension - feeder that catches suspended food including benthic larvae ( Levin , 198 1 ; Tamaki , 1984a ) but it also deposit - feeds .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR B-LIFE_STAGE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Most marine fish and invertebrate species produce free and small early - stages which are part of the plankton .	 O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O B-LIFE_STAGE I-LIFE_STAGE I-LIFE_STAGE I-LIFE_STAGE O O O O O O O O O
 These incompletely developed individuals are highly vulnerable to unsuitable conditions like starvation and environmental variability , and it was early recognized that survival during these stages often regulates recruitment and adult population size ( Cowan and Shaw , 2002 , Pineda et al . , 2007 ) .

 Recruitment theories have thus focused on the environmental modulation of larval survival , and they generally assume that while spawning occurs within relatively fixed time - frames along the year cycle , hydrographic conditions and plankton production show higher inter - annual variability .

 The three species exhibit similar behaviour and ecological preferences .	 O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 They are inhabitants of shallow reef areas , usually encountered in less than 10 m depth .	 O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O
 During the day they are mainly sedentary , frequently seen resting on the bottom under rock or coral outcrops on substrata containing substantial amounts of sand , silt , mud , or algae .
