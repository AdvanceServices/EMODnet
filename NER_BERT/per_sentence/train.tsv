 The basic procedure in field experiments examining adult - larval interactions is to establish plots from which adults which may interact with settling larvae are removed or in which densities of such adults are varied , and to compare the larval densities there with those in control plots .

 Although cages are most commonly used to assess the influence of larger predators such as fish , crabs , and epibenthic predatory benthos on infauna , they also provide a good opportunity to study competitive or adult - larval interations between infaunal species which can attain high densities within cages .

 Atherinids are small marine , estuarine and freshwater fishes not exceeding 120 mm SL ( a soon to be described species of Craterocephalus may reach 300 mm SL ) , occurring predominantly in the Old World , with only Alepidomus evermanni ( freshwaters of Cuba ) and two marine species , Atherinomorus stipes and Hypoatherina harringtonensis ( predominantly in the shore waters of the Caribbean ) known from the New World .

 In the Southeast Pacific , the family is only known only from Tumaco , Colombia , according to Dyer .	 O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 All freshwater atherinid species are derived from marine ancestors and until recently have only been known from the rivers of Australia , New Guinea and some islands in the vicinity of the latter .

 This study evaluated the connectivity between an intermittently closed - open lagoon ( LR ) and adjacent coastal waters ( CW ) , and the influence of that connection on ichthyoplankton assemblages .

 We performed field surveys along a year in LR and CW to capture different sandbar states ( open / closed ) and lagoon - sea connectivity processes ( e.g. lagoon discharges , marine intrusion , overwashing ) .	 O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Results showed differences in environmental conditions and ichthyoplankton communities between LR and CW , and also evidenced different mechanisms of exchange of water and ichthyoplankton .	 O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 At least three estuarine species were found to spawn and use LR as a nursery ground .	 O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O
 Larval stages of six marine species were found at CW .	 B-LIFE_STAGE O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 Environmental factors ( e.g. wind and runoff ) and species - specific traits ( e.g. life cycle strategy , spawning season ) determined ichthyoplankton exchange vs. retention .	 B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O
 Marine estuarine - related species entered LR mostly during summer - autumn , at their peak abundance in CW .	 B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 Sandbar closure did not impede the entrance of these species .	 B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O
 Overwashing events ( closed bar ) and light onshore winds during the open - sandbar period were the most important process that promoted the transport of these larvae into LR .	 O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LIFE_STAGE O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O
 Conversely , there was no evidence of entrance of marine estuarine - independent larvae to LR .	 O O O O O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O B-LIFE_STAGE I-LIFE_STAGE O O O
 Eggs and larvae of estuarine species that spawned within LR were effectively retained there , except when heavy rains led to severe lagoon discharges .	 B-LIFE_STAGE O B-LIFE_STAGE O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O
 Similarly , unusual strong onshore winds advected eggs from CW to LR , possibly reducing their survival .	 O O O O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR I-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-LIFE_STAGE O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O O O O
 Generally , eggs were more vulnerable to drift than larvae .	 O O B-LIFE_STAGE O O O O O O B-LIFE_STAGE O
 Many of the estuarine larvae that drifted out of the lagoon seemed to survive , suggesting a loss of individuals from the lagoon population but a potential contribution to the genetic flux among coastal populations .

 There is an urgent need to develop predictive indicators of the effect of species loss on ecosystem functioning .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Body size is often considered as a good indicator because of its relationship to extinction risk and several functional traits .	 B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Here , we examined the predictive capacity of species body size in marine and freshwater multitrophic systems .	 O O O O O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O B-DISTRIBUTION_DESCRIPTOR O O O
 We found a significant , but weak , effect of body size on functioning .	 O O O O O O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O O O
 The effect was much stronger when considering the effect of body size within trophic position levels .	 O O O O O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O O O O O
 Compared to extinctions ordered by body size , random extinction sequences had lower multiple species loss effects on functioning .	 O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Our study is the first to show experimentally , in multitrophic systems , a more negative impact of ordered extinction sequences on ecosystem functioning than random losses .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Our results suggest apparent ease in predicting species loss effect on functioning based on easily measured ecological traits that are body size and trophic position .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-BODY_SIZE I-BODY_SIZE O O O O

 Although specimens were large and sexually mature , the histology indicated that the gonads of this November sample were in a resting stage .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

 Ruanoho decemdigitatus and Ruanoho whero have overlapping sympatric distributions and differ in body size , attaining a total length of 12 cm and 9 cm , respectively .

 R. decemdigitatus was most commonly found in sheltered areas shallower than 5 m , while R. whero was frequently found in sheltered to moderately exposed areas down to 20 m. In sites where the species co - occurred , R. whero was less associated with rock substratum .

 Reproductive behaviour was assessed in courtship , mate choice and hybridisation trials .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Both species exhibited similar habitat preferences , but large R. decemdigitatus were dominant in inter- and intraspecific contests for the preferred rock habitat , while small R. whero were displaced into less preferred habitats .

 The marine catfish genus Paraplotosus Bleeker is reviewed .	 O O O O O O O O O
 Three species are recognised : P. albilabris ( Valenciennes ) from the Indo - Australian Archipelago , P. muelleri ( Klunzinger ) from north - western Australia and adjacent Northern Territory , and an undescribed species from northern Australia .

 Paraplotosus butleri , new species , is described from 40 specimens , 26 - 325 mm SL , collected mainly from coastal seas of northwestern Australia .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
