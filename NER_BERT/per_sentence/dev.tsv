 Bleheratherina pierucciae is described from Tontouta ( 26 ° 56.9 ’S 166 ° 14’E ) and Pirogues Rivers , New Caledonia .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 The new species has been compared with other IndoPacific atherinids , both freshwater and marine ( representatives of genera Atherinason , Atherinomorus , Atherinosoma , Atherion , Craterocephalus , Hypoatherina , Kestratherina , Leptatherina and Stenatherina ) and an atherionid ( Atherion ) .

 Dyer & Chernoff ’s ( 1996 ) division of Atherinidae into three subfamilies has been briefly reviewed and a fourth subfamily , Bleheratherininae , is now added to this list since the new species is distinct and different from all known atherinids .

 Bleheratherina pierucciae can be immediately recognised by the unusual structure of its mouthparts .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
 Other distinct osteological characters confirm that it merits a subfamilial status .	 O O O O O O O O O O O O
 The evolutionary history of this new species must have commonality with the Australian coastal and marine fishes , having probably been derived from a common ancestor likely to have occurred in a marine environment i.e. Arafura Sea .

 The zoogeographic events , which led to the separation of New Caledonia from Australia and its emergence as a separate island , post Palaeocene , must have led to a divergence of the ancestral fauna which invaded the freshwaters of New Caledonia .

 Three species are recognised : P. albilabris ( Valenciennes ) from the Indo - Australian Archipelago , P. muelleri ( Klunzinger ) from north - western Australia and adjacent Northern Territory , and an undescribed species from northern Australia .

 Paraplotosus butleri , new species , is described from 40 specimens , 26 - 325 mm SL , collected mainly from coastal seas of northwestern Australia .

 It is clearly distinguishable from congeners by its black colouration , longer dorsal fin , longer barbels , and greater number oflowerlimb gill rakers and upper procurrent caudal rays .

 Paraplotosus muelleri and P. albilabris are similar in appearance and habits , but are separable on the basis of dorsal fin height and eye size , which are invariably greater in P. muelleri .

 Newborn young measured from 2 to 20 mm in length , which was a narrower size range than the 17 - fold difference that occurred in adult size .

 Both eggs and young were larger than expected among marine teleosts , even when considering only those with parental care , but brood size at release was lower than expected , perhaps because the young were more developed .

 Considerable research is needed to advance seahorse conservation and management , including ( a ) fisheriesdependent and fisheries - independent abundance estimates , ( b ) age- or stage - based natural and fishing mortalities , ( c ) growth rates and age at first maturity , and ( d ) intrinsic rates of increase and age- or size - specific reproductive output .

 Current data confirm that seahorses are likely to be vulnerable to high levels of exploitation With maximum sizes of over 100 kg ( DeVries 1998 ; Kock and Everson 1998 ) , the Patagonian and Antarctic tooth ® sh of the genus Dissostichus are an important resource and the largest ® sh in the Southern Ocean .

 Their size , neutral buoyancy , pelagic nomadic lifestyle and piscivorous feeding behaviour are unusual within a notothenioid group dominated by small , sedentary de mersal ® she s ( Eastman 1993 ) .
