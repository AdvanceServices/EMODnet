These incompletely developed individuals are highly vulnerable to unsuitable conditions like starvation and environmental variability, and it was early recognized that survival during these stages often regulates recruitment and adult population size (Cowan and Shaw, 2002, Pineda et al., 2007). Recruitment theories have thus focused on the environmental modulation of larval survival, and they generally assume that while spawning occurs within relatively fixed time-frames along the year cycle, hydrographic conditions and plankton production show higher inter-annual variability.\")\n",
