In the Southeast Pacific, the family is only known only from Tumaco, Colombia, according to Dyer. All freshwater atherinid species are derived from marine ancestors and until recently have only been known from the rivers of Australia, New Guinea and some islands in the vicinity of the latter.\")\n",

Counts were madeusingthetechniquerecommendedbyHubbs & Lagler (1958) so as to make comparisons with previously described atherinid species. Two speci�mens were cleared and stained usingthe method of Taylor (1967), Taylor & Vandyke (1985) and Dingerkus & Uhler (1977). These were measured and counted prior to clearing. Drawings were made with the assistance of a stereomicroscope. Osteological comparisons were made with repre�sentatives of marine Indo-Pacific atherinds and an atherionid (Table II). Specimens collected by H. Bleher�s party were deposited in the Australian Museum Sydney, those borrowed from the MNHN were returned to that institution. All of the specimens that have been examined are desig�nated as types.\")\n",
