INTRODUCTION

Save what is recorded in the Fisheries reports issued since 1920
by the Fisheries Research of Egypt, there is no published account
concerned with a description of the Egyptian Sardine Fishery, and
for this reason it appears to me to be desirable to write a short note
on this fishery as regards composition, locality, season, annual total
production, importance, ctc., before proceeding to discuss the chemical
aspect of the subject.

Three species of the genus Sardinella compose our Sardine Fishery,
of which the S. aurita (allache) constitutes about 80 per cent of the
total production ; the remainder consists of 8. eba save for the neg-
ligible percentage of less than 0°50 per cent of 8. granigera,

S. aurita (Allache).

Migratory, travels in big shoals, appears in considerable quantities
about two to five weeks time after the flow of the Nile flood reaches
the Mediterranean. At the time of its first appearance the fish is
lean and exhausted after spawnmg during the summer months.
Some of the fish are still full, but these form a very small percentage
of the total. The fish start to feed vigorously on the Nile mud con-
tents of phytoplankton and on the swarms of the marine diatoms
and perydinians and other phytoplanktonic forms, which flourish
abundantly at that time due to the effect of the vast quantities of
fresh water discharging inte the sea.
—?—

The fish rapidly fatten and the catches increase in size until
they reach a maximum by November. :

With the fall of the Nile flood the fishery begins to slacken gradually
until it practically ceases by the end of January. Thus the season,
in some years, extends from mid-August to the end of January,
while in others it fluctuates by starting a little later and ending a
little earlier. The season seems to depend mostly on the height of
the flood and also on the prevailing physical and chemical conditions.

After the season is ended, the fish leave the inshore waters and
migrate into deeper waters probably in an easterly direction.

Average individual size of the fish during season 18 cms.

Average individual fresh weight of the fish during season.70 grains.

S. eba.

This species seems to be more local than 8S. aurita and lives
along the shores in the shallower waters.

During season October—January it mixes up with S. aurita and
travels in big shoals.

The fishermen’s catch is often a mixture of the two species ;
sometimes composed entirely of 8. aurita while at others it consists
exclusively of 8. eba.

Average individual size of this fish during season 14 cms.

Average individual weight of this fish during season 35 grams.

After the season is ended, this fish disappears for 3 to 4 mouths
until it again re-appears during the very limited summer inshore
Sardine Fishery, localised so far at Alexandria Eastern Harbour.
The summer fishery ground extends only from Alexandria to Abou
Kir in the inshore waters of not more than 20 fathoms.

The number of boats engaged in this fishery does not exceed 20,

The quality of the fish is poor and their gonads are approaching
ripening and maturation aud the fish are ready to move to deeper
waters to spawn.

The quantities, produced from this summer fishery, are compara-

tively small and are consumed fresh locally. 8. eba is generally
the predominant fish in the catches, S. aurita being rather rare

during this fishery.
Average individual size of §. cba during summer fishery 14°5 cnis.
Average individual weight of 8. eba during summer fishery 28 grms.
Average individual size of 8. aurita during summer fishery 17 cms.
Average individual weight of 8. aurita during summer fishery
52 grams.
S. granigera.

This is a rare fish, compared with the other two species and
does not play anv signifieant part in the economics of the Sardine
fishery. It generally appears carly during the summer fishery men-
tioned above. Its presence in the catches does not occur later than
May-July. This fish ts caught in small quantities at Alexandria
Harbour in a westerly direction. It seen to prefer life in waters
deeper than 20 fathoms. (V.B.-—The deepest waters in which the
fisherman can work on is bounded by the depth of his net, which in
Kevpt does not exceed 20 fathoms).

This species does not make more than 10 per cent of the summer
fishery, which in its turn does not exceed 5 per cent of the total pro-
duction of the Sardine fishery all the vear round.

Average individual size of this fish during May-July 18 crus.

Average individual weight of this fish during May-July 48 grams.

The Sardine fishery is centered along the Northern coast of
Keypt at Abou Kir, Rosetta. Broullos, Damietta and Port Said,

Table T shows that the average annual landing returns of this
fishery during the last ten years are estimated at 4,880°3 metric tons,
while in the same period the total production of our sea fisheries,
practiced along the Mediterranean coast, Red Sea coast and along
the Suez Canal with its Jakes amounts to an annual average of 9,218°7
metric tons.

The annual sardine catches exceed by far those taken of any
other marine fish in Egypt and as shown above make up 48°4 per cent
of the total landings of our Sea Fisheries. It is thus obvious that
any attempt to develop the Sea Fisheries industry should deal first
with the development of the sardine fishery.

With the importance of the sardine fishery in view, the writer
started the biological and chemical investigations on the sardine
in the hope that these investigations might help its economic deve-
lopment.

The complexity of the problem has become increasingly apparent
and has necessitated careful consideration from different aspects.
As a result it was found convenient to deal with the chemical and
biological aspects separately.

In a previous paper by the writer on the “ Dietetic Value of
certain Egyptian Food Fishes ” 22 species including the sardine were
considered. The chemical analyses for the determination of the
percentages of Protein, Fat, Ash, and Water in the flesh of 21 species
were carried out, while in one further species the Karous (Morone
Labraz) a study of the gross chemical changes, which occur in the
different tissues during the process of maturation and reproduction
was made.

As the protein constitutes to a large extent the protoplasm of
the living tissue, its percentage in the flesh of fishes does not greatly
vary between individual fish, between different species, or between
fish from different localities.

In contrast with the protein-content, the fat-content in the so
called fat-rich-fishes such as herring, pilchard, sardine, makerel, ete..
varies greatly between individual fish, between species in different
localities and at different seasons of the year.

Fish fats and oils are of great value as foodstuffs because of their
high caloric value. They have also further importance as foods
because of their more lor less intimate association with three very.
valuable accessory food substances, namely, Vitamins A, D and KE.
The presence of the three vitamins in the dict 1s of prime imfpor-
tance for the proper economy of the body.

The industrial importance of fish oils, extracted from whole
fishes or from the offal of the canneries in the case of herring. pil-
chard. sardines, salmon, ete., 18 increasing as their particular properties
are becoming known. Fish oils are now-a-days considered a relatively
valuable raw material in the general factory consumption of fats and
oils, required by various industries.

From a table, given by the U.S. Department of Commerce for
the year 1929 and recorded by Brocklesby and Denstedt (1933), the total
consuniption by factories of fish oils is estimated at 188,102 thousand
pounds, consumed in the varions industries as follows :-—

The oil of the miscellaneous industries are mainly consumed in
the leather tanning industry, of which the annual consumption 1s
estimated at 8,000 tons and also in the manufacture of greases and
lubricants ; and sometimes for general purposes one class of mineral
oils is blended with another class of fish oils.

Besides the importance of fish oils and fats in the foods and m
the different industries mentioned above, the success of canned sar-
dine as regards quality and flavour depends to a certaim extent on
the degree of its oiliness. Rich fatty sardines generally make a good
quality canned food stuff, while the poor weak fish produce a low grade
of canned sardine.

As the economic value of the sardine increases with the increase
of the degree of tts fatness, the study of the fat-content of sardine
and its properties throughout the year in order to establish the dif-
ference between individual fish ; between different sexes ; between
species ; between localities, and above all between the different
seasons of the year, is essential for the development of the Sardine.
Fishing Industry on sound and scientific basis. This paper is a pre-
luminary survey of the fat metabolism of our sardine,

COLLECTION OF SAMPLES

Biological and chemical investigations on sardinella were carried
on during the seasons of 1933-1934 and 1935-1936. The reason of
the break in 1934-1935 season was due to the absence of the writer on
board R.R.S. ~ Mabahiss ” on her trip to the Red Sea (December 1934
to February 1935) for biological and hydrograpbical investigations.

Samples of fish were, whenever possible, collected from the
marketable catches, landed at various fishing centres, After the
count of the sample and its analysis tnto the three species of sardinella—
S. aurita, S. eba and §. granigcra--the biometrical and biological
investigations of Jength; sex: age; state of maturity ; condition
of intestinal fat and examunation of the food-contents of stomach
were recorded on every Individual fish. These observations will be
published later on.

Length was measured from the tip of the snout to the end of the
longest caudal fin ray in the dorsal fluke of the tail.

Several scales from the anterior region near the tip of the pectoral
fin were removed and prepared in the same way described by Channon
and Saby (19382) for the count of winter rings under a projector or a
binocular microscope according to the method of Lea (1910).

It was found convenient to record the state of maturity, according
to the classification of Hjort’s scale. The adopted classes of this
scale actually encountered were :-—

.—lImmature virgin or spent fish not yet recovered ;
T].-—Maturing virgins or recovering spents ;
HIT. Gonads filling one-half of the body-cavity ;
1V.—Gonads filling more than two-thirds of the cavity ;
V.—Gouads full, fillmg the body cavity.
The quantity of fat round the alimentary tract was observed

and is recorded as the “mesenteric” fat in the terms, “no fat” ;
“Tittle fat’; “some fat“) “ verv fat.”

Throughout this work on the biological and the biometrical data
on the three species of sardinella, samples of a few fishes for the che-
mical analyses were selected to represent as far as possible a fair
average of these factors,
-

As the fat content of the whole fish and that of the muscle are
the most important from the dietetic and industrial point of view,
it was decided in the first place to carry out estimations on samples
from this point of view.

Later on and during the summer fishery of 1935, when the fish
were poor and lean and of little invportance for canning or production
of oil, attention was given to the study of the chemical changes which
occur during the process of maturation and investigations made as
to any possible difference between. males and females in this respect.

The selected fish were weighed in granis and treated as follows :—-

(a) After the careful removal of the scales. the fish were taken for
the determination of the fat content and were finely cut
into small pieces.

(b) In the case of the estimation of the fat-content of flesh, the
sample was taken by cutting a narrow fillet of the flesh,
from behind the head to the tail region after careful removal
of the skin.

(c) Gonads were readily obtamed by dissecting the selected fish.

The selected samples were then stored in stoppered jars
under excess of acetone until they were later worked up,
as time allowed. Table IJ gives the history of all the
samples taken for analyses.

METHODS OF ANALYSES

The methods of analyses were very sinilar to those described by
Channon and Saby (1932) in their preliminary study of “Fat Me-
tabolism of the Herring.” In all cases the acetone was removed fron
each sample by filtration through a Buchner funnel. ‘The residue
was repeatedly treated with warm fresh aectone and filtered. The
final residue, after being finely ground in a mortar, was then extracted
with ether in a Soxblet apparatus for about 6 hours. The combined
acetone extracts was evaporated to dryness in vacuo and the residue
was dissolved in ether and filtered. The filtrate obtained was added
to the ethereal extract from the Soxhlet extractor and the whole
was then distilled and evaporated and dried 7 vacuo at 100°C. The
fat-content of the tissue is expressed as the weight of this ethereal
extract.

In some samples the amount of the ethereal extract was so small
‘that only a few of the fat constants could be determined on account
of lack of material. In these cases the fat was saponified and deter-
minations of iodine number of the unsaponifiable fraction and of
the fatty acids made.

Acid Value: 3 to 5 grams of the fat were dissolved in 40 ce. of
neutral mixture of alcohol and ether (7 parts alcohol to 3 parts ether)
and titrated with 0-1 N alcoholic sodium hydroxide solution, using
phenolpbthalein as indicator. The results were calculated as mg
of potassium, hydroxide required to neutralise the free fatty acids of
one gram of the ethereal extract.

A portion. of the fat was then saponified by boiling with excess
of alcoholic potash until much of the alcohol was removed. This
was followed by dilution with water in an extraction funnel and the
ethereal extract of the unsaponifiable fraction was obtained by 5 to 6
extractions with ether. The ethereal extract, after washing with
water to neutrality, was distilled and dried at 100° C in vacuo and the
unsaponifiable fraction thus obtained. The combined soap solutions
and aqueous washings were then acidified with conc. Hydrochloric
acid, and similarly extracted with ether. After washing to neutrality
the ethereal extract was evaporated and the residue dried in vacuo
at 100°C. It was then dissolved in petroleum ether and allowed
to stand over night. The light petroleum solution, after being filtered,
was evaporated to dryness at 100°C im vacuo, and the fatty acids
are obtained.

Todine values of the unsaponifiable fraction and the fatty acids
were determined according to the method of Rosenmund and
WKuhnhenn (1923.)

It should be noted that carly in summer small quantities of
poor fish are caught in the coastal waters from Alexandria to Abou
Kir. These fish, being very lean and generally either unripe or im-
mature start to feed on the zooplankton mainly Copepoda and in
the meantime the reproductive organs mature. As the fish feed, the
fat content increases up until it reaches its maximum for this period
just before the fish go on the hunger migration to spawn.

This summer fishery or the spawning period is represented m
Table IJ of 8. aurita by 4 samples Nos. 19, 23. 43 and 46: in Table IV
of 8. eba by one sample No. 27; and the one sample of S. gratugera.
while the rest of the samples of whole fish analyses of S. aurita and
8. eba were taken during the fishing season or the extensive feeding
period.

The results of the analyses of the spawning period show that
in the case of 8. aurnta the percentage yield of fat of the whole. fish
was in May < 3°37 when gonads were immature or unripe. shghtly in-
creased in July to 3°78, “while it rose up by the end of August to 81
when the fish were full and about to spawn. The mean value for the
four samples taken from this fish during summer period was 5°64 per
cent of fat. In the case of the other two species the process of gradual
increase of fat in the whole fish during this period could not be traced
as one sample only was Sample 21 of the whole fish
of S. granigera, taken in May contained 2°92 per cent while sample 27
of 8. eba taken in July contained 7:19 per cent of fat.

As the fish feed very vigorously during the fishing season on the
abundant marine Phytoplanktonic forms, the amount of fat in the
different tissues of the fish is continually enriched and the excess is
deposited as the “ Mesentric ” fat round the alimentary tract. The
results recorded in Table IIT for 8. aurita show a striking rise in the
fat content during this period as the percentage of fat in October
varied from 23°76 in sample 49 to 30°79 in sample 3 and rose to a
maximum 34°66 for sample 9 taken in November, with an average
value for the season—October to January—of 30°42 as against 5°64.
the mean value obtained during the spawning period.

Figures of Table [V of S. eba show great similarity as to the
striking increase of the fat content in the whole fish during the period
October to January, with a mean value of 31°82 per cent of fat as
against 7°19 per cent in July.

To record the seasonal changes in the fat content of the two species
8. aurita and S. eba, the results obtained in Table III and Table IV
for the fat content of the whole fish are expressed graphically in Fig. I,
assuming that samples of the two species were completed during the
fishing months of one and continuous period (May—-January). When-
ever more than one sample were dealt with in any month, the mean
value of their percentages of fat was taken. to represent the percentage
yield of the ethereal extract of the fish im that particular month.

Fre. I.—Variation in the Fat-content of whole-fish analyses of S. aurita and
8S. eba during fishing months (May-Jan.)

Before the discussion of the figures concerned with the varia-
tion in the percentage yields of fatty acids and unsaponifiable matter
with the iodine values and acid numbers, it is desirable to note that
the ethereal extract in the manner obtained in this work contains
a variety of substances :-—

(a) The unsaponifiable fraction —This consists largely of cho-
lesterol.

(b) Phosphatide.—This consists largely of lecithin.
(ec) Triglyceride.—This is the neutral fat “ oil.”

(d) Eatraneous material. which is not truly soluble wm pure ether.—
The material appears in the extract because of the presence
in them of phosphatide. If phosphatide is dissolved in
ether, the ether solution of the phosphatide will dissolve
many other things that are not soluble in pure ether.

The amount of (a), (6) and (d) will practically remain constant.
irrespective of whether the fish is rich or poor in fat (c). When the
fat content of the tissues increases, most tf not all that is mereasing in(e).

The next point to mention is that fatty acids which are present
in the phosphatide are more unsaturated usually than are those in
the triglyceride. Bearing these facts in mind the results recorded
in Tables LH and IV and in the case of the one sample of 8. granigera.
concerned with the variation of the vields of fatty acids and unsaponi-
fiable matter with their iodine values are easy to explain.

During summer fishery the fish are lean and the ethereal ex-
tracts of samples contain very little triglyceride as against a high
percentage of the other constituents— unsaponifiable matter, phos-
phatide, and extraneous materials—the properties of which would
be most prevailing in the analyses of the extracts of this period.
Fo. example the extracts would be expected to contain a lower per-
centage yields of fatty acids with more unsaturated nature due to the
concentration of phosphatide : a higher percentage of usnaponifiable
material: and an increased acid number on account of the higher
percentage of phosphatide and other extraneous material present. in
the extract.

When the fish fatten during the feeding season the amount of
the fat content rapidly increases due to the stziking ircrease of the
amounts of the triglyceride or the neutral fat, the properties of which
would be most prominent and dominating those of the other cons-
tituents in the analyses of the extracts of this period. For example
the percentage yield of fatty acids in the extract shows a tendency to
increase, while the fatty acids become less unsaturated ; a mucli
lower percentage yields of unsaponifiable matter : and a sharp decrease
in the acid number as phosphatide and other extraneous material
being subsided by the neutral fat.

The results obtained from the analyses were :—

(1) From May to August. or the spawning period, —-A conrpara-
ney lower percentage vields of fatty acids ranged in case of S. aurita
Table {17 between 77-96 and 86°20 with a mean value 82-09, and in
— b—

Table IV of 8. eba there was one sample only and its yield was 86°74
per cent while the sample of 8. granigera gave a corresponding value
of 82°13 per cent. The unsaponifiable matter in case of 8S. aurita
Table ITI varied from 2°88 per cent in August to 4°96 per cent in July
giving a mean value 3°75 per cent; the corresponding value in the
sample of 8. eba Table IV was 3°48 per cent while in the sample
of 8. granigera being 5°3 per cent.

The figures in Table III show that the iodine number of fatty
acids varied from 117°3 when percentage of fat was 7°3 to 144-1 when
percentage of fat was at its lowest 3:37, giving a mean value of 131°1
for this number during May to August, while the range of the variation
in the iodine number of the unsaponifiable matter during the period
was limited between 59°] and 77°6 with a mean value of 704. The
iodine number of fatty acids in the case of the sample of 8. eba and
that of 8S. granigera were 132°9 and 167'1 respectively while their
corresponding values for the iodine number of the unsaponifiable
matter were 78 and 70:1. In the case of 8 aurita Table III the acid
number varied between 218 and 37°3 with a mean 28°3 and in the
sample of 8. eba Table IV its value was 19 but in the case of the
sample of 8. granigera no determination was made due to the lack of
material.

(2) The feeding period October to January.--The yields of fatty
acids showed a tendency for increase in Table LIT of S. aurita the
percentage yields ranged between 85°24 and 927 with an average
value of 89°16, while this range of variation in the case of 8. eba
Table TV was between 86:92 and 91°07 giving a mean value 89-2.
The percentage yields of unsaponifiable matter in the extract de-
finitely decreased-.-these varied fron. 0°59 to 1°05 giving an average
vield for the whole season 0°78 per cent in the case of S. aurita Table ITT,
while in the case of 8. eba Table [TV the corresponding variation was
between 0°35 to 1-08 with a mean value of 0°83. During this period
the fatty acids become less tinsaturated and the iodine numbers
obtained varied in the case of 8. aurita Table IIT between the two
extremes 101-3 and 129°2. giving an average iodine value 110°7, and
in Table TV of 8. eba two deterninations only were made and gave
the numbers 96°9 and 103-0. The iedine numbers of the unsaponi-
fiable matter varied irregularly and insignificantly from a minimum
of 56°6 to a maximum of 91-0 giving a mean of 69 in the case of 8. aurita
Table TIT, and from 55-2 to 65°4 with a mean 60°5 in the case of 8. eba
analyses. During this period the acid numbers strikingly decreased
and their range of variation was from 3°8 to 14°2 with a mean 6°2 in
the analyses of S. aurita Table TTT, and from 3°5 to 7°8 with an average
value 6°0 in the analyses of 8. cba Table LV.

From the figures recorded in Table V and in Table VI, it is clear
that the fluctuations in the fat content of flesh are very similar to
those previously described in the case of the estimations of that of
the whole fish.

Here again it was found out that during the feeding season the
fat content of the flesh from 8. aurita Table V was lowest at 12 per cent:
in October ; rose to a maximum 28°21 per cent in December, and
ended in January at a value 24-46 per cent giving a mean value for
the whole fishing season 21°37 per cent of the fresh flesh In Table VI
three samples only Nos. 8, 12 and 18 were taken during this period
for the analyses of the flesh of S. eba-the fat content in them
varied from 23°85 per cent to 29°42 per cent with a mean value
25°84 per cent.

On the other hand the fat content of the flesh during the summer
fishery, May to August, is represented in Table V of 8. aurita with
four samples--its value varied between a minimum 2°65 per cent in
July and a maximum 9°16 per cent in August, with an average value
for this period of 5°33 per cent of the fresh tissue. In the case of the
flesh of 8S. eba Table VI seven samples were taken during this period,
the fat content in them varied between the two extremes 2°55 per cent
in July and 13-22 per cent in Angust giving a mean value of 5°85 per
cent.

In the case of S. aurita Table V the two samples 44 and 47 and in
the case of S. cba samples 30 and 32: 35 and 37: 39 and 41 are of
particular interest since each pair was taken on the same day under
simular conditions and from the same catch to show the difference,
if any, between the two sexes. The results obtained for the per-
centage yield of fat of the two sexes are tabulated in the following
table :-—-

These figures show a close similarity between the two sexes in
the fat content. The apparent difference between the two samples
39 and 41 and the two samples 44 and 47 is probably attributed
to individual variations rather than to a sexual difference.

The seasonal changes in the percentage yields of fat from the
flesh of the two species 8. aurita and 8. eba are graphically expressed
in Fig. IL, assuming the continuity of sampling as was done in Fig. I.

Whenever more than one sample of flesh were taken from the
same species in any month, the mean values of the percentages of
fat were taken.

Fic. IT.—Variation in the Hat-content of the flesh of S. aurita and
S. eba during fishing months (May-Jan.)

Fig. [1 indicates a steady rise in the fat content of the flesh of
both fishes from summer, when ripening and maturing fish were
caught, to the autumn and early winter. when the fish were extensively
feeding.
— 0 —

The maximum amounts of fat were apparently attained later on,
at about the end of the fishing season. There was only one sample
No. 22 taken on June 30, for the flesh of 8. granigera. The ethereal
extract of the flesh was 3°14 per cent of its fresh weight. The yield
was insufficient for the analyses to be carried out.

The variations in the properties of the ethereal extracts of flesh
from both fish 8. aurita and S. cha show close similarities to those
of the ethereal extracts of the whole fish previously explained.

The extracts of the spawning period gave comparatively lower
percentage vields of fatty acids with more unsaturated nature: higher
percentage vields of unsaponifiable matter with increased iodine
values ; and a definite rise in the acid number, while the properties
of the extracts of the feeding period varied in a reverse sense. The
mean values obtained for the properties of fat from the flesh of both
species during the two periods of feeding and spawning are recorded
in the following table :--

PART IIT,

The Fat-Content of the Gonads

During the mouths July and August 1935 maturing and ripening
fish mainly of S. eba were caught with their gonads at the stages ITI,
TV and V of Hjort’s scale.

Samples of ovaries and testes of S. eba and S. aurita were taken
and treated in the same way as in the case of the flesh of each species
for the estimation of the fat content.

Due to the rarity of S, aurita in the summer catches, only 4 samples
taken for the maturing reproductive organs of this fish—2 for each
sex with their particulars ag recorded in Table VIL.

These data show a difference in the mean value of the percentage
yields of the fat content between testes and ovaries—the respective
values being 5-49 and 7:06. There are also apparent differences be-
tween the percentage yields of fatty acids and between the yields
of unsaponifiable substances in the extracts of testes and ovaries, but
it is not safe to make any deductions from only two analyses of each
sex. These differences are dealt with later when the results obtaimed
for 8. eba are discussed.

The variation in the amounts of fat content of the gonads of
S. eba with their properties are recorded in Table VIII.

These figures show that the mean values of the percentage yields
of ether extracts from the gonads of S. eba varied between the two
sexes—being in milt 4°16 and in roes 69. This result fairly agrees
with the corresponding mean values in Table VIT obtained from the
analyses of the gonads of 8. aurita.

The amount of fatty acids in the extracts also varied between
males and females -its meat value in milt being 43°05 per cent and
in Ovaries 58°90 per cent. On the other hand, the yield of unsaponi-
fiable matter varies in the reverse sense, i.e. 14°86 per cent in males
and 11°24 per cent in females.

The mean value of the iodine numbers of fatty acids showed a
difference between testes and ovaries, being in the former 115°5 and
in the latter 126-5. The analyses showed also a corresponding dif-
ference in the average iodine values of the unsaponifiable substances,
being intestes 73-09 andin ovaries 78°15. This difference in the iodine
values between testes and ovarics indicates that the fat of the testes
is more saturated than that of the ovaries, but this point—due to the
few analyses dealt with here- needs a farther study before it can be
finally settled.

CONCLUSION

The variation in the chemical composition of a species of fish
does not only occur between individuals, but it also occurs with the
different seasons of the year. This result was established by several
workers on the chemical composition of food fishes--among whom
Atwater (1888), who analysed 52 species of American food fishes ;
Clark and Aly (1918) in their work on 20 species of Atlantic food
fishes > Dill (1921) in bis study of a number of Pacific food fishes ;
Balland and Hollande in their study of Kuropean food fishes, and Saby
(1938) m the work on the dietetic value of 22 species of Egyptian
focd fishes may be mentioned.

The amount. of fat present in species having a low fat content
docs not undergo wide variation between individuals. On the other
hand the fat contents of fat-rich species such as: salmon, herring,
shad. sardine, ete.. show striking variations between individual fish,
between species in different localities and at different seasons of the
year,

The works of Vaescher-Ruesch on the Rhine salmon; Paton on
the Scotch salmon: Green (1919 and 1921) on the Pacific Coast
salmon: Milroy (1906. 1907. 1908) on the museles and gonads of
Loch Fyne herrings: Johnstone (1915, 1918. 1919. 1920) on the
estimations of the nuscle fat of Manx-herrings : Bruce (1924), Chan-
non and Saby (1932) on the fat metabolism of the Manx herrings
— 33 —

strikingly show that the fat stored in the body during the periods of
growth and feeding is the immediate source of energy expended by
the fish at the time of its spawning migration, when no food is taken.

The analyses of the three species of Sardinella were undertaken
over a period long enough to show the range of variations in the fat
content of whole fish. flesh. and gonads. The results of the analyses
showed a close similarity to those obtained by the different authors
in their investigations on herring, salmon, shad, etc., and can be
concluded in the following :—

(1) The comparison of the mean values obtained for the fat
content and its properties of whole fish, flesh, and gonads of 8. aurita
and §&. cba shows that these values are essentially identical in both
species all the year round. When 8. granigera appeared, it showed
similarity to the other two species.

(2) Radical changes occurred in the tissues as regards the fat
content and its properties. These changes could be pictured for the

two periods when the mean values of the results are tabulated such
as in Table EX.

These figures show :—-

(a) Close similarity between the mean values obtained for the
analyses of the whole fish and flesh during the two periods
of feeding and spawning save the percentage yield of the fat
content of whole fish during feeding period was greater than
that of the flesh due to the presence and accumulation of the
“ Mesenteric fat” round the alimentary tract.
(6) The increase in the fat content of whole fish and flesh from
the spawning period to the feeding period in both species
S. aurita and 8. eba caused—an increase in the percentage
yield of fatty acids with a definite fall in their iodine values ;
a decrease in the unsaponifiable substances with an apparent
decrease in their iodme values ; and a striking fall in the acid
values of the extracts.

(3) Neither specific nor sexual differences were observed between
males and females of the two species 8. aurita and 8. eba as regards
difference in the fat content and the properties of the fat.
